#### Description:
- Lang Buddy is desktop app which may helps you to learn and remember new foreign languages words and expand your vocabulary.

- You can create your own dictionary with words and their translations and test yourself time to time.

- Each word in dictionary has own rating (0.0 to 20.0) based on user answers during tests. Also app stores user guess sequence which shows while word edit opens.

- App (presumably :)) should support any languages you want - just add respective options into **constants.py** manually.

- It has build-in Goolgle Translation API support for on-the-fly autotranslation.

- Also you can import from txt file prepared words set or just use any article as data source. ***Make sure if txt file has UTF-8 encoding!***

- Application support UI customizing with color and fonts changing.
